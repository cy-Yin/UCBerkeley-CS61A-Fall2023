# UCBerkeley-CS61A-Fall2023

This repository contains all the materials of the course "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" in the UC Berkeley CS 61A in the semester of fall 2023, including the discussions, exams and my solutions of all the 10 homework, 14 labs and 4(+1) projects (1 optional).

One can find the course website [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/).

Since the open videos (which one can find both in the [fall2023 Home Page](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/) and in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@JohnDeNero)) are the same as those in the semester of [fall 2022](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/), and considering that more lecture slides are provided in the version of fall 2022, I just put all the fall 2022 slides in this repository instead of fall 2023 slides. One can find them in the `Slides_fall22` folders.
